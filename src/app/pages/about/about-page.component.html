        class="lcc-link"

        laws of chess</a
      >, set by the International Chess Federation (FIDE). Notable differences are the
      <i>touch-move</i> rule: we enforce touch-move during rated rapid tournaments but
      <i>clock-move</i> for our casual blitz tournaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members are encouraged to try to resolve any disputes with their opponents before
      seeking arbitration. If you would like to speak to an arbiter, pause the clock and
      raise your hand to get their attention.

    <p>
      Chess tournaments are held throughout the year. These include casual blitz
      tournaments, rapid tournaments, and the London Chess Championship held in the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Blitz tournaments are unrated and free to play, with a time control of 10+0 (10
      minutes for each player, with no increment after each move).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Rapid tournaments are rated with a time control of either 25+0 or 40+0. For our
      rated tournaments there is a nominal entry fee (usually $10) that goes towards the
      prize pool and covers any expenses in organizing the event.
